  <h3>SMOS-Box</h3>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>The BEAM SMOS-Box project has been brought into life in order
  to support users of data acquired by ESA's Soil Moisture and
  Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. BEAM and the SMOS-Box are user
  tools which ESA/ESRIN are providing free of charge to the Earth
  Observation Community.</p>

  <p>The SMOS-Box software has been developed by <a href=
  "http://www.brockmann-consult.de/">Brockmann Consult</a> under
  ESA contract initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC) and coordinated
  Peter Regner (ESRIN).</p>

  <h4>License</h4>

  it and/or modify it under the terms of the <a href=

  ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
  General Public License for more details.</p>

  <h4>Supported Data Products</h4>

  <p>Version 2.0 of the BEAM SMOS-Box is capable of reading SMOS
  data products complying with Schemas Release
  2010-02-12_v04-04-06. The product types supported are listed in
  the table below.</p>

  <h4>Tools and commands</h4>

  <p>Version 2.0 of the SMOS-Box includes five SMOS-specific tools
  and commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Grid point data
    table: all measurements made for the grid point selected by
    either the mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a
    table.</li>

    <li>Grid point flag
    matrix diagram: all flags associated with the measurements
    made for the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer or
    a selected pin are displayed in a flag matrix</li>

    <li>Grid point brightness
    temperature chart: All brightness temperatures measured for
    the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer or a
    selected pin are displayed in a chart</li>

    <li>Snapshot
    information tool: information for all snapshots contained
    in a Level-1c Science product can be browsed with a slider</li>

    <li>Grid point export
    command: exports all data for a user-defined set of SMOS
    grid points into a plain text file</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Known Limitations</h4>

  <p>Version 2.0 of the SMOS-Box has the following known
  limitations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All SMOS data products are represented as global products
    covering the whole surface of the Earth. Therefore SMOS
    products do not have a geographical boundary</li>

    <li>Due to the representation of SMOS products as global
    products, it is not possible to draw lines or shapes crossing
    the anti-meridian</li>

    <li>Statistics, scatter plots, histograms and profile plots use
    image pixel data rather than SMOS grid point data</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Further Information</h4>

  <p>The most important source of information for BEAM and the
  SMOS-Box are the <a href=
  "http://www.brockmann-consult.de/cms/web/beam/forum">BEAM
  Forum</a> and the <a href=
  "http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam-wiki/display/SBOX/">SMOS-Box
  Wiki</a>.</p>

  <h4>Reporting Issues</h4>

  <p>You can submit BEAM bug reports or feature request to the
  <a href=
  "http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam-jira/browse/SBOX">SMOS-Box
  Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
